## What's going on with this data?

As an avid user of public transport, I wanted to figure out the effects of different variables on how late the public transport was. From this information I can hopefully have better judgement on If I should sleep that extra minute or not.

(please note: not all data came from me, I had help from friends and my sister)

## How late public Transport is in general
The first thing I wanted to know is how on time the public transport system is in general. 

![A bar chart showing how late Transport is ](plot1.png)
From this I found that the delay in this part of the year was much better than from when I did this in March, also that our mean amount of delay is 1.2 minutes.

However for my quest of perfecting the least amount of wait time at a bus stop, this doesn't tell me enough.

So what else could effect Public Transport tardiness?

## Does the day of the week effect delay?

I wanted to know if I traveled on a Friday, would there be more likely of a delay compared to a Tuesday. Since I think people are more likely to stay and work from home on a Friday I believed that there would be more delay on the middle days

![A bar chart showing the averages of delay depending on day of week](plot2.png)

Well, not exactly what I was expecting, but there does seem to be more delay on the middle days compared to the end days.

I take public transport all times of the day, would that effect the delay?

## Does the time you Travel Impact the delay

With the morning and evening rush I expected there to be some effect on the delay

![A density graph of the time of day and delay](plot3.png)

As I expected, There is definitely an effect on the delay from what times it was taken, however I definitely thought there would be more of a effect.

Would the route I take have an effect?

## Effect of route on Delay

Since different routes experience different conditions would that impact there tardiness? 


![A scatter graph of the delay of different routes I took](plot4.png)
So there is an impact on delay depending on what routes taken. 

But most importantly did I enjoy myself?

## Top thoughts on Public Transport

![Top ten words I used to describe my time taking public Transport](plot5.png)
Seems pretty hot or cold... I obviously didn't have the best of times.
